= Select Benchmarks for Timefold Solver

This repository is a continuous work in progress, and it will change as our needs change.
There are no guarantees that anything in this repository will still be here tomorrow,
or that it will look anything like it looks today,
or that it will work against any particular version of the Solver.

== Microbenchmarks

=== Usage

To run the benchmarks, you need access to Timefold Solver Enterprise Edition.
Having acquired that, run any of the benchmarks:

[source,shell]
----
./run-coldstart.sh
./run-scoredirector.sh
----

The benchmark results will be published as a subdirectory in the `results` directory,
and they will include flame graphs if Async Profiler is available.

In the default configuration, the benchmark will run for many hours and fully occupy 1 CPU.
Only run the benchmark on a quiet machine, otherwise results will be skewed.

=== Configuring the benchmark

The benchmark is configured using the `coldstart-benchmark.properties` and `scoredirector-benchmark.properties` file.
The file is well-commented, and should be self-explanatory.
Modify it to suit your needs.

== TSPLIB95 and CVRPLIB benchmarks

Runs the solver against well-known academic datasets:

* http://comopt.ifi.uni-heidelberg.de/software/TSPLIB95/[TSPLIB95]
* http://vrp.galgos.inf.puc-rio.br/index.php/en/[CVRPLIB]

=== Usage

To run the benchmarks, you need access to Timefold Solver Enterprise Edition.
Having acquired that, build and run any of the benchmarks:

[source,shell]
----
mvn clean install
./run-tsplib95.sh
./run-cvrplib.sh
----

The benchmark results will be published as a CSV file in the `results` directory.

In the default configuration, the benchmark will run for many hours and fully occupy 4 CPUs.
Only run the benchmark on a quiet machine, otherwise results will be skewed.
