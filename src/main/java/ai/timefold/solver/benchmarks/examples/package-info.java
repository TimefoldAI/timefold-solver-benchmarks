/**
 * This package contains the remains of the old Swing-based solver examples.
 * They serve as testbed for benchmarking the solver.
 * They were pared to the bone, removing all the code that was unnecessary for their new role.
 * They should no longer be used as a showcase of solver features,
 * as they no longer exhibit the latest features and best practices.
